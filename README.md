### Hi, Iâ€™m Iryna Skaraieva ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front-End Developer transitioning into IT after many years of working in education. My teaching experience has equipped me with strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork capabilities. With a foundation in JavaScript, React and HTML/CSS, I focus on crafting functional, visually appealing web applications to enhance user experiences.  

Fast learner, adaptable, and detail-oriented.

Looking for opportunities to contribute to projects and enhance my technical skills.
